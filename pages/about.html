    <p>Hey there. I’m a cybersecurity professional and lifelong Linux enthusiast based in the tri-state area of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. With over a decade as a Windows System Administrator and two decades of hands-on Linux experience, I specialize in making complex tech understandable—whether it’s for compliance, automation, or just plain curiosity.</p>
    <p>My current focus is PCI DSS compliance and secure infrastructure, but my interests run deep: from Python, PowerShell, Bash, and Batch scripting to modding game consoles, reverse engineering binaries, and exploring the weird and wonderful world of cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>When I'm not auditing Active Directory or soldering a mod chip into a Nintendo Switch Lite, I’m usually tinkering with automation scripts, building JBOD/ZFS storage setups, or experimenting with weird browser UIs. I’m also a big fan of the small web, minimalist interfaces, and creative problem-solving.</p>
    <p><strong>My mission?</strong> Demystify technology. I believe the best tools are the ones people feel empowered to use—so I try to break things down into bite-sized, actionable pieces anyone can understand and use.</p>
    <p>I’m also the mind behind a few side projects like <strong>defaultcreds.lol</strong>, a small web aggregator for cybersecurity headlines and tools.</p>
    <p>If you’re into hacking, scripting, electronics, 3D printing, old-school emulation, or just need help figuring out why your firewall hates you—stick around. I probably have a script for that.</p>
    <p><strong>Want to connect?</strong> Shoot me a message. I’m always up for swapping ideas or helping someone figure out their next tech move.</p>
